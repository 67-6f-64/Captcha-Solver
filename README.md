# Captcha-Solver
You can use this harvester for Supreme, Shopify, etc just replace the host and sitekey for the site you want to solve for

This harvester removes expired captcha tokens automatically

Make a GET request to 127.0.0.1:8080/fetch to grab the token, once you make a GET request it also removes the token
